= Modular Power Heaters

== Building Information:
Heaters are used to burn fuel to make heat. Currently, there are 4 variants: Biomass, Coal, Solution and Nuclear.

Once the heater reaches 100{nbsp}℃ the attached Boiler will then start producing Steam, the temperature will reach 2{nbsp}000{nbsp}℃ for the nuclear heater. 750{nbsp}℃ for the solution heater and 500{nbsp}℃ for the rest.

The heater will produce CO₂, which will need to be handled by either venting through a chimney or accumulating into Carbon Dust. If the CO₂ is not resolved and fills the heater, it will stop producing heat and slowly cool.

== Variants:

=== Biomass Heater
The biomass heater can produce 500{nbsp}℃ heat and can be fed with the following items:

|===
| Item   | Heat / Cycle | Item consumption rate | CO₂ production rate
| Leaves|0.5|240|30{nbsp}m³
| Wood|1|36|45{nbsp}m³
| Mycelia|2|180|45{nbsp}m³
| Alien Carapace|10|15|30{nbsp}m³
| Fabric|5|240|30{nbsp}m³
| Alien Organs|10|15|30{nbsp}m³
| Biomass|20|20|30{nbsp}m³
| Solid Biofuel|30|8|30{nbsp}m³
| Packaged Biofuel|35|4.8|45{nbsp}m³
| Flower|0.25|36|45{nbsp}m³

=== Coal Heater
The coal heater can produce 500{nbsp}℃ heat and can be fed with the following items:

|===
| Item   | Heat / Cycle | Item consumption rate | CO₂ production rate
